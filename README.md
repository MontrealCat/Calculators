Machine-learning-algorithm-based calculators for structrual behaviors of concrete bridge structures





This calculator is a prediction model based on the existing test database for the mechanical properties of concrete bridge structures \nusing several efficient machine learning algorithms. The authos hope further promote the research on the mechanical properties of concrete bridge structures.



Notice:Please follow the steps to select three things:\n\n 1. The behavior you want to calculate. 2. The algorithm you want to use. 3. The feature selection method you want to apply.



Now include the following behaviors of concrete bridge structures:
Shear Transfer Strength (STS) of Cast-in-place Concrete Joints (CCJ)
Punching Shear Strength (PSS) of Cast-in-place Concrete Slab-Columm Joints (CCSCJ)
Direct Shear Strength (DSS) of Precast Concrete Joints (PCJ)
Effective Stiffness (ES) of Precast Concrete Columns (PCC)
Drift Capacity (DC) of Precast Concrete Columns (PCC)
Residual Drift (RD) of Precast Concrete Columns (PCC)
